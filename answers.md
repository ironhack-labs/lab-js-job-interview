1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: b
  - Explanation: The output of the code will be 2 times de "xyz" because inside of the function we're giving the variable a new value, we have a console.log that will run the variable and another console.log that runs in the function.


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: The output of the code will be 10 and then 1 because inside of the function the variable is reassigned a new value, which only affects the value inside it.The console.log inside of the function will run first and the console.log outside will run the value unmodified.


3. Challenge 3:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: The output of the code will be "Hi there" because even if the function is declared on the top, the function is found and runs what's inside of the console.log.


4. Challenge 4:
