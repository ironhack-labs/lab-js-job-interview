1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: b
  - Explanation: because the variable is a let and that can be change it any time in the future


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: In the code a is a let variable defined as 1 but in the function is declared as a 10 so the first console log only shows the a inside the function not the variable per se, so when the second console.log prints the a is the let a=1


3. Challenge 3:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: in this exercise doesn't matter inf the console.log is inside the function it only shows the string be cause it doesn't follows or prints any rule


4. Challenge 4:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: in the exercise a is an object with a property num defined as 42. then b is assigned to the same object a so when the code modifies b.num to 90 the initial object that a is pointing to


5. Bonus - Challenge 5:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: in the function obj.age is modified to 10, then a new object is created and assigned to obj (argument of the function) but this doesn't change the original reference to the function. Then when rabbit1 is passed and modified to have the age of 10 and so as the new declared object happens inside the function it doesn't affect rabbit1, so the function then returns this new object assigned as rabbit2
