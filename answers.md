1. Challenge 1:

  - Answer: b) "xyz" and "xyz"

  - Explanation:  there's a variable named foo with a value of "abc". The function, if called, would change foo to "xyz" an then log it to the console. The function is called changing the value of foo to "xyz" and loging it to the console. Finally there's a console.log that would log the value of foo again as "xyz".


2. Challenge 2:

  - Answer: c) 10 and 1

  - Explanation: the example function changes the value of its parameter to 10 and then log it. When calling the the function we're passing the variable "a" as the argument. Therefore, the function will change it's value to 10 and then log it. However this value of 10 will only stay within the function and will not affect the original value of a. Therefore, when logging "a" outside of the function it keeps it's own value of 1.

3. Challenge 3:

  - Answer: c) "Hi there!"

  - Explanation: The functions are sotored at the beggining of JS and will appear when called, regardless of the possition in the code file.


4. Challenge 4:

  - Answer: c) { num: 90 }

  - Explanation: because we didn't do a copy of the values, we just referencedd the original object, therefore, changing annything would reflect on both constants.


5. Bonus - Challenge 5:

  - Answer: a) { name: "Bob", age: 30 } and { name: "Ada", age: 20 }

  - Explanation: we first log the constant rabbit1 as is. hten when logging rabbit 2 the function changes all the properties the original object has overwriting it.
