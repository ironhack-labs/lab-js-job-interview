1. Challenge 1:

- Answer: B
- Explanation: Firstly, the output will be "xyz", because we redefine the variable, and because it's a let, the output can change. Next, we execute the function "bar", which has "foo" defined as "xyz".

2. Challenge 2:

- Answer: C
- Explanation: First - we log function a, which has a defined a as 10. It overwrites the first a, as it is a let. The assignment inside the "example" function affects only the a inside this function, that's why the second output is equal 1, as it was declared outside the function before.

3. Challenge 3:

- Answer: C
- Explanation: The name of the function doesn't affect the text printed. It's only a name of the function that is called. The console.log specifies the print "Hi there".
